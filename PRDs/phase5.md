# PRD: Daily Operating System (DOS)

Version: 1.0

Status: Ready for Development

Priority: Highest

Owner: Personal OS

---

# Vision

Personal OS should have ONE screen that answers everything I need to know today.

Instead of opening multiple modules:

Health

Finance

Career

Learning

Planner

Coding

The Daily Operating System aggregates everything into one intelligent, actionable dashboard.

This becomes the application's home page.

It should be the only page I need to open most days.

---

# Philosophy

The dashboard should answer four questions:

1. What changed?
2. What should I do?
3. What needs attention?
4. Am I moving toward my goals?

Nothing else.

No unnecessary charts.

No information overload.

---

# Design Principles

## Action over Analytics

Never show information without a possible action.

Bad

Calories
1380

Good

420 calories remaining

---

## Delta over Absolute

Always show change.

Bad

Weight
107.8kg

Good

107.8kg

↓ -0.4kg since yesterday

---

## Today's Context Only

This page is about TODAY.

Historical analysis belongs elsewhere.

---

## One Screen

Everything important fits without scrolling on a laptop.

Scrolling should reveal details,

not required information.
