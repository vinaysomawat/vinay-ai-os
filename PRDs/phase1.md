# Design Principles

## 1. Density over whitespace

This is a power-user application.

Avoid giant empty cards.

Prefer compact layouts.

Display more useful information without feeling crowded.

---

## 2. Reduce Clicks

Every extra click is a failure.

Examples:

❌ Click card

↓

Click edit

↓

Edit

↓

Save

Instead:

Inline editing.

---

## 3. Consistency

Everything should use identical:

- spacing
- radius
- typography
- buttons
- dropdowns
- dialogs
- icons
- hover effects
- shadows

No page should look like it was built separately.

---

## 4. Immediate Feedback

Every action should provide feedback.

Examples:

Task completed

→ check animation

Expense added

→ toast

Workout completed

→ confetti burst

Save

→ optimistic update

continue polishing.

Implementation is complete only when the application feels cohesive, premium, and intentionally designed rather than feature-rich but inconsistent.
