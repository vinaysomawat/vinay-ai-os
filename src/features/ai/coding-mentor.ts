${company ? `He has an active application at ${company.company}. Its job description flagged these priority topics: ${company.topics.join(', ')}.` : 'No active application with analyzed priority topics right now.'}

Candidate questions (already filtered to ones he hasn't solved, each with its id, title, difficulty, and tagged topics):
${candidates.map(c => `- id="${c.id}" | ${c.title} | ${c.difficulty} | topics: ${(c.topics ?? []).join(', ') || 'none'}`).join('\n')}

Pick the 3-5 BEST questions from this exact candidate list for him to practice next — prioritize his weak areas, the company's priority topics if given, and your knowledge of what's currently frequently asked in frontend interviews at top product companies. Quality over quantity: fewer, sharper picks beat a long list.

Return ONLY a JSON array in this exact format, ordered best-first:
[
  {"questionId": "...", "reason": "..."},

questionId MUST be copied exactly from the candidate list's id values — never invent one. reason is one sentence explaining why this question, now.`
