Create a focused study plan for today. Include:
1. **Main focus** (60 min): which resource, what specifically to cover
2. **Quick review** (15 min): something to revise from recent learning
3. **Optional** (if time): one thing to start or explore

Be specific — reference actual resource names and chapters/topics. Keep it under 150 words.`

2. Your knowledge of current frontend interview trends and what's frequently asked at top product companies right now.
3. Recent frontend/JS ecosystem developments worth knowing.

Order them by priority — the most important one first, with the reason explaining why it matters right now (interview relevance, ecosystem shift, or gap in his current progress).
